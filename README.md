# Project Name : MapApp404



## Authors

# Overview
Our program works by using user input to output a list of tailored locations as well as a map to pinpoint respective locations.

When our program runs, it takes you to the first landing page (the main page) where you enter: 

- current mood/feeling (e.g I am feeling perplexed today).
- current postal code.
  
The postal code will be given to the Google Maps API and it will return 20 nearby locations. Based on these location reviews and the user's prompt, the Deep Seek API will return a list of 5 locations that the user can go to. 

As a result, there are three landing pages; one for the user to input all information, one to display the top 5 recommendations, and one to display the map.



# Purpose

The purpose of our program has been designed to allow users find the top rated locations (e.g. restaurants, cafes, theme parks, stores) based on their current emotional state. 

If the user is feeling stressed, our program will generate nearby locations such as, cafes, spas, parks, etc., and output them onto a map for the user's visualization.

# [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)
1. The program source code can be obtained by clicking the green code button. From there, you can either:
   
a. clone the repository using the provided link
   
   i. Copy the url.
    
   ii. On IntelliJ IDEA (or any other JAVA IDE) create a new project from version control.

  iii. Paste the project's link into the URL section.
  
   iv. Click clone.



b. download the project directly as a ZIP file

The program runs with JDK24, so ensure your IDE is configure to use JDK24. If your IDE is set to a different JDK version, update the project settings so it uses JDK 24 to avoid compatibility issues by following these steps. 

i. Head to project structure.

iii. Then, press apply. 


2. The program requires a DeepSeek and Google Maps API Key and a DeepSeek endpoint that can be acquired from these links : 
- DeepSeek API : https://platform.deepseek.com/sign_in

- GoogleMaps Places API : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service

A .env needs to be created. Right click on this directory as specified in the picture.

# [Features of the Software](#features-of-the-software)
The first feature of this software involves user authentication. User's are required to submit their name, postal code, and current mood in order for our software to identify prime locations (login screen). The program then displays a list of the top nearby locations with respective addresses (recommendation screen). For better viewing, the user can click on the "view map" button, a map of the surrounding area will appear along with the posted locations pinpointed on the map (map view screen).

On the back-end, this program uses DeepSeek in order to find common synonyms for the user's inputted current mood, as well as Google Maps to find nearby locations with reviews that match the user's mood, in some capacity.


### Landing Page 1 (Login Screen):

User fills in their mood and current location postal code.
