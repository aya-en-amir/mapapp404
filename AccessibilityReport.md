# Project Accessibility Report 

## Principle of Universal Design
1. Equitable Use

The program can be used by a wide range of users without requiring specialized knowledge. However, additional accessibility features can be added to make it more inclusive for people with varying abilities
   
2. Flexibility in Use

   In the future, the program could allow voice recording format as an alternative to typing to provide more options for different user needs. 
   
3. Simple and Intuitive Use

   The landing page has clear instructions on what the user needs to type to run the program. The program also specifies the required input format, such as the postal code format.  
4. Perceptible Information

   The program communicates errors through text and illustration. In the future, an audio alert could be used to communicate to users with different sensory abilities . 
5. Tolerance for Error

   Currently, the program currently has to be restart if the user makes a mistake. Adding "back to previous page" could help users to correct errors without starting over. 
6. Low Physical Effort

    The program only required typing several words. The program could enable location detection from the user's device, reducing the amount of information needed to be entered. 
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

    The progam could offer a customization options, such as an adjustable font size or dark mode view, to ensure that the interface remains comfortable for users with varying needs.

   ##
The program is suitable for a wide range of people. It is ideal for local residents and tourists looking for new places to discover in their neighborhood. 
Additionally, it is suitable for people who can't make their choices easily, since the program provides the top 5 places that match with the user's emotional state.

However, the program is less likely to be used by individuals with visual impairments because it relies primarily on text to convey information. This creates barries for users who depend on screen readers or other assistive technology. Future improvements could include adding voice commands or speech recognition technology to increase inclusivity of the program.
