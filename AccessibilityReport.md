# Project Accessibility Report 

## Principle of Universal Design
1. Equitable Use

   
2. Flexibility in Use

   In the future, the program could allow voice recording format as an alternative to typing. 
   
3. Simple and Intuitive Use

   The landing page has clear instructions on what the user needs to type to run the program. The program also specifies the required input format, such as the postal code format.  
4. Perceptible Information

   The program communicates errors through text. In the future, an illustration or voice alerts could be used to communicate to users with different sensory abilities . 
5. Tolerance for Error

   Currently, the program currently has to be restart if the user makes a mistake. Adding "back to previous page" could help users to correct errors without restarting. 
6. Low Physical Effort

    The program only required typing several words. The program could enable location detection from the user's device, reducing the amount of information needed to be entered. 
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

    The progam could allow the users to adjust font size or view mode to ensure that the interface remains comfortable for users with varying needs.

   ##
   The program is suitable for a wide range of people. It is ideal for local residents and tourists looking for new places to discover in their neighborhood. 
Additionally, it is suitable for people who can't make their choices easily, since the program provides the top 5 places that match with the user's emotional state.

##
The program is less likely to be used by individuals with visual impairments because it relies primarily on text to convey information. This creates barries for users who depend on screen readers or other assistive technology. Future improvements could include adding voice commands or speech recognition technology to increase inclusivity of the program.
